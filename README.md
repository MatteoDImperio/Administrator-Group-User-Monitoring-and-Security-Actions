# Administrator-Group-User-Monitoring-and-Security-Actions
This PowerShell script monitors Windows security events in real-time, specifically looking for events where a user is added to the "Administrators" group. When such an event is detected, the script takes several security actions, including deleting the user from the system and capturing a photo via the webcam.
